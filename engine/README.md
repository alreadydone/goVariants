# Go-Variants-Engine
This module provides a Go engine for standard [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) and toroidal Go (t-Go). It may in the future handle Go on other graphs that are locally like Go like cylinders, twisted toroids, Klein surfaces, â€¦ 

At present the primary function of the module is to handle the mechanics of making a move on a board. It counts liberties, and determines which if any stones are removed as a consequence of the move. Later on [superkos](https://senseis.xmp.net/?Superko) and [scoring](https://senseis.xmp.net/?Scoring) may also be implemented.
